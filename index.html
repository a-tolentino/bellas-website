        <h2>Hey Bella, I'm sorry and I love you</h2>
        <p>
            I'm typing this right now after our big talk and I know that right now you're feeling some type of way about me.
            it's 12am right now while i'm typing this and I know you're probably wondering why I'm silent but I just want you to understand
            that it isn't because I don't want to talk to you but it's because i'm typing this out for you. I know typing this out and making a website for you
            is a little strange and funny but I just want to show you that I care and idk if making a whole website shows that but I just want you to know that I care and I love you so much.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love you with every ounce of my heart and my soul and no one, not even you, could deny it. You've made me really understand 
            the true feeling to what love really is and you will always emmbody what I believe is love. I am the most grateful and happiest man I could ever be when I'm with you
            and I'm so glad I get to call you my girlfriend, my bestfriend, my (soon) wife, and my everything. I really believe that you are the only one for me and I would be the dumbest person
            if I lost someone as perfect, beautiful, loving, and funny as you.
        </p>

        <h2>You mean the world to me Bella</h2>
        <p>I could never imagine my life without you. You are the greatest blessing that has ever been givin to me and I have been such an idiot for treating you this way.
            I am serious when I say I have already planned my entire life out with you so you can never leave my side and I don't care you have no choice.
            I can't wait to gradute college, start our lives together and live our boring, sweet lives together because that is all I dream and wish to do for the rest of my life.
            I want to make you the happiest girl in the world the same way you make me the happiest man in the world. You deserve every ounce of happiness and love and I would do anything
            and everything to make sure you feel that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just really am sorry for always dissapointing you and I know you always have to deal with my imperfections and mistakes all the time
            but i'm so glad that you can put up with them and me. I know I can be considered a terrible person for what I did to you and I fully understand
            if I am seen that way. What I did to you was terrible and no person should ever have to go through that especially you and I'm sorry that I am the one person 
            in your life that is putting you through this much pain, stress, and anxiety. I am continuing to change and better myself for both of our benefits and I will always be there for you
            to try my best to make you feel loved and important. No matter how you feel about me, whether you hate me or not, I will always continue to support you and your happiness no matter where 
            you find it. Again, I really am sorry and no amount of sorries said will ever amount to how guilty and ashamed I am for how I treated you.
            I just want to make things right for us no matter what the cost is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides everything, I really do love you from the bottom of my heart and theres nothing in the world that could ever take me away from you not even my own death.
            I can never get over the way your hair sits perfectly on your face and I love the way your hair matches the color of your beautiful eyes. Your eyes will always be 
            so beautiful to me and I can never get over the way they look. I just can never get over you and how perfect of a person you are to and for me. I would be happy to
            live my whole life making you feel loved they you make me feel loved. You mean so much to me my love and I wish to spend my whole life with you. 
        </p>
